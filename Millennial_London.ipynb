This project is targeted towards young professionals looking for new homes in London, stakeholders that provide housing targeted at young professionals, or city planners that are looking to make neighborhoods more millenial friendly.\n",

        "To determine which neighbourhoods are millenial friendly we will focus on neighborhoods with low crime rates, affordable rental prices and easy to access to nearby entertainment.\n"
