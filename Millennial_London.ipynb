        "In this project I will aim to identify millenial-friendly neighborhoods in London. This project is targeted towards young professionals looking for new homes in London, stakeholders that provide housing targeted at young professionals, or city planners that are looking to make neighborhoods more millenial friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finding a neighbourhood that is millenial-friendly can be hard. Especially, in big cities like London. There are many variables to consider such as crime rates, rental prices, availability of public transport, and nearby enterainment.\n",

        "To determine which neighbourhoods are millenial friendly we will focus on neighborhoods with low crime rates, easy to access to nearby entertainment and \n"

        "The ease of access to public transport will be assessed using the PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) which rates the accessibility of locations across London to public transport. Each area has a rating  between 0 and 6b, where a score of 0 means the area has very poor access to public transport, and 6b means there is excellent access to public transport. \n",
